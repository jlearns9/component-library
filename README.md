Welcome to my react component library project

In this project I used various techniques in order to create re-usable components.

My focus with this was to make it as easy to understand for the next developer if they wanted to come and add different variations of each component to the project.

The techniques I used in order to achieve this are, but not limited to:
- useContext
- children
- custom hooks
- state
- onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave

All in all I'm very proud of the work I've done with this project.
